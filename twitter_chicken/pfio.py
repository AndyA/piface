THIS IS A STUB AND SHOULD BE REPLACED BY THE ACTUAL PFIO MODULE!!!

If you write the pfio module in another directory then just link to it
in this one using:

	$ ln -s ../relative/path/to/actual/pfio.py pfio.py

Don't bother adding the link to the git repo since it may not stay
relative and we can always just recreate it.
